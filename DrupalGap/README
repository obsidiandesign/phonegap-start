|==============|

0. Enable the DrupalGap Module on your Drupal Site

     Drupal Module: http://www.drupal.org/project/drupalgap
     Documentation: http://www.drupal.org/node/1603690

1. Complete the PhoneGap Getting Started Guide

     http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/guide_getting-started_index.md.html

2. Download the files needed for the latest version of jQuery & jQueryMobile,
   and save each file to PhoneGap's assets/www directory:

     http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.min.js
     http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.min.js
     http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.min.css
	
3. Download the jQueryMobile zip file:

     http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.zip

   Extract the images directory from it into PhoneGap's assets/www directory so
   this directory exists:
   
     assets/www/images
   
   Note, this is different than the img directory that is created by PhoneGap's
   getting started guide.

4. Download DrupalGap and extract its contents to PhoneGap's assets/www
   directory so drupalgap.js is located here:

       assets/www/DrupalGap/drupalgap.js

     DrupalGap 7 Download

       https://github.com/signalpoint/DrupalGap/tree/7.x-1.x
     
     DrupalGap 6 Download

      https://github.com/signalpoint/DrupalGap/tree/6.x-1.x

5. Open DrupalGap/app/default.settings.js and save a copy of it as settings.js
   so the copy of it lives here: 
   
     DrupalGap/app/settings.js
   
6. Specify your Drupal site path (with NO trailing slash) in settings.js,
   for example:

     'site_path':'http://www.drupalgap.org'
   
7. Copy the contents of DrupalGap/pages and DrupalGap/scripts to the assets/www
   folder so these files (and many more) exist:
   
   assets/www/index.html
   assets/www/dashboard.html
   assets/www/dashboard.js

8. Run your new mobile application!

===================================

From here you'll have a great start to building a mobile application that
integrates with your Drupal website. Please visit the DrupalGap project
homepage for more information.
